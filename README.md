# InterpreterOfArithmeticExpressions

The purpose of this project is to provide a straightforward simulation of a lexer and parser for arithmetic expressions. Initially, the program loads a .txt file 
containing arithmetic expressions written in standard notation. The program also includes a feature for storing the results of arithmetic expressions in variables, 
which can be printed to the console using the "print(variable)" function. Operator associativity has been properly implemented, ensuring that unary operators take 
precedence over binary operators, and parentheses are used to modify the order of operations. The supported arithmetic operations include addition, multiplication, 
subtraction, division, and unary negation.
